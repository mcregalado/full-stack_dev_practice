# 🎨 CSS Exercises — My Frontend Practice Journey

Welcome to my collection of **CSS exercises**, inspired by [The Odin Project (TOP)](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
This repository contains various small projects and challenges designed to strengthen my understanding of **HTML and CSS fundamentals**, layout techniques, and responsive design.

## 🧠 About This Project

These exercises serve as my **hands-on practice** while following The Odin Project’s Foundations course.  
Each folder contains a small challenge focusing on specific CSS concepts — from basic selectors and properties to advanced layouts like **Flexbox** and **Grid**.

I’m using this repo to:
- Reinforce my frontend fundamentals  
- Experiment with different design approaches  
- Track my growth as a future **full-stack developer**

## 🧩 How I Work on These Exercises

1. **Read the exercise instructions** in the folder’s README.  
2. Open the provided HTML and CSS files in my IDE (VS Code).  
3. Modify the `style.css` (and sometimes the HTML) until the result matches the given “Desired Outcome”.  
4. Verify my work using the self-check list included in each exercise.  
5. Commit my progress with meaningful messages as part of practicing **Git and GitHub workflow**.
