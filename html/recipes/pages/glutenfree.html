    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Gluten-free flour</b>: Opt for an all-purpose gluten-free flour, as it can be substituted for regular all-purpose flour using a 1:1 ratio. Recipe creator SueAnne McInnis suggests Cup4Cup gluten-free multipurpose flour.</li>
        <li><b>Baking powder</b>: Baking powder as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
        <li><b>Salt</b>: A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors, but it won't make your cookies taste salty.</li>
        <li><b>Sugars</b>: You'll need white sugar for the cookies and confectioners' sugar for the icing.</li>
        <li><b>Butter</b>: Unsalted butter goes into the cookie dough and into the 4-ingredient icing.</li>
        <li><b>Vanilla</b>: You'll need two teaspoons of vanilla extract â€” one for the cookies, one for the icing.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs</b>: Two large eggs add moisture and richness. Plus, they help bind the dough together.</li>
        <li><b>Cream cheese</b>: The sweet, rich, tangy icing starts with softened cream cheese.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Make the cookie dough</b>: Whisk the dry ingredients together, then beat the wet ingredients together. Gradually stir the dry mixture into the wet mixture. Form the dough into a ball and chill in the fridge for about an hour.</li>
        <li><b>Roll, cut, and bake the dough</b>: Roll the chilled dough out on a floured surface and cut with cookie cutters. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to brown.</li>
        <li><b>Make the icing</b>: Beat the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla together. Stir in the confectioners' sugar. Spread the icing on the cooled cookies.</li>
    </ol>
