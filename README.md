# Road to Being a Fullstack Developer

This repository documents my personal journey toward becoming a **Fullstack Developer** — combining front-end creativity with back-end logic to build complete, functional, and user-friendly applications.

Along the way, I’ll be exploring:

-  **Frontend Development** — HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-  **Backend Development** — Node.js and database management with SQL
-  **Frameworks** — React.js, Flutter, and Dart 
-  **Version Control & Deployment** — Git, GitHub, and cloud platforms   

Each project, folder, and commit represents a step forward in learning and mastering fullstack development. A roadmap, growth log, and a reflection of progress.
